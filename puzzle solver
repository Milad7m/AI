Create a new Python file and import the following packages:
from logpy import * 
from logpy.core import lall 
Declare the variable people:
# Declare the variable
people = var()
Define all the rules using lall.
The first rule is that there are four people:
# Define the rules 
rules = lall(     # There are 4 people     (eq, (var(), var(), var(), var()), people), 
The person named Steve has a blue car:  
# Steve's car is blue  
(membero, ('Steve', var(), 'blue', var()), people), 
The person who has a cat lives in Canada:   
# Person who has a cat lives in Canada 
(membero, (var(), 'cat', var(), 'Canada'), people), 
The person named Matthew lives in USA: 
# Matthew lives in USA 
(membero, ('Matthew', var(), var(), 'USA'), people), 
The person who has a black car lives in Australia:   
# The person who has a black car lives in Australia   
(membero, (var(), var(), 'black', 'Australia'), people), 
The person named Jack has a cat: 
# Jack has a cat     (membero, ('Jack', 'cat', var(), var()), people), 
The person named Alfred lives in Australia:  
# Alfred lives in Australia     
(membero, ('Alfred', var(), var(), 'Australia'), people), 
The person who has a dog lives in France:  
# Person who owns the dog lives in France     
(membero, (var(), 'dog', var(), 'France'), people), 
One of the people in this group has a rabbit. Who is that person?   
# Who has a rabbit?     
(membero, (var(), 'rabbit', var(), var()), people) ) 
Run the solver with the preceding constraints:
# Run the solver
solutions = run(0, people, rules) 
Extract the output from the solution:
# Extract the output
output = [house for house in solutions[0] 
if 'rabbit' in house][0][0] 
Print the full matrix obtained from the solver:
# Print the output 
print('\n' + output + ' is the owner of the rabbit')
print('\nHere are all the details:')
attribs = ['Name', 'Pet', 'Color', 'Country'] 
print('\n' + '\t\t'.join(attribs)) 
print('=' * 57) 
for item in solutions[0]:   
print('')   
print('\t\t'.join([str(x) for x in item]))
